# ITEC_2905_Capstone

# **Javafx HCRGen application**

## Synopsis
This is an application to Generate reports for Tong's Fire Extinguisher Sales and Service, 

## Motivation
This is a program for the ITEC_2905_Capstone class at Southwest Tech. 
I created this program for my Capstone project in that class. In cooperation with Tong's Fire Extinguisher Sales and Service

## How to use
This program is utilized via a javafx GUI.

The user will enter customer information for the report through the GUI using text fields, dropdown boxes, date picker, and text area.

The user will add report information for the service that was completed in the kitchen hodd area of the GUI.

The User will finish the report after all the information has been input, by clicking the print preview button on the bottom of the page.

the User can capture the report as a file in two ways, by clicking the print button on the print pane, or by selecting the page and hitting the enter key.

## Code Example
here is a code example of the user adding information through the UI using radio buttons.
```
	public void setYes(String input, String btName){
		switch (btName){
			case "dKWrb1": dkWSt = "Yes"; break;
			case "fWPrb1": fWPSt = "Yes"; break;
			case "dIFrb1": dIFSt = "Yes"; break;
			case "aFHrb1": aFHSt = "Yes"; break;
			case "fDWrb1": fDWSt = "Yes"; break;
			case "hLWrb1": hLWSt = "Yes"; break;

## Future Goals, updates, Bugs, and fixes.
*email functionality to send the customer the report directly from the Application.
*Photograph integration, access the camera from the aplication and attach the files along with the report for email to customer.
*Fix the wrap text problem for the notes TextArea in the print stage.
*On action event for the technician notes and miscellaneous notes text areas. to help with flow
*Remove cleaning, claims, and Event notice from user UI
*Need to add code for all text areas in the report pane not just the main text area. specifically the on action event for the ENTER key.
